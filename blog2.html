     <h1><strong>  The Rain Drop Brothers
</strong></h1><br />
<font-family="calibri"> Creating this portfolio was definitely interesting. I enjoyed the creative process of story making. However, <br />
I found it overwhelming. I looked up youtube videos on how to use twine and found that there were endless features-- both accessible and <br />
seemingly inaccessible in relation to my skill set. The man on most of the videos was using an apple computer so I could not follow <br />
along which was very frustrating. I chose to do a rain drop story, inspired by the magic school bus, becaue I figured it would have <br />
many connecting elements and would not limit my story telling opportunity. I tried to change the font style however I could not <br />
figure out how to do so. I looked up HTML codes and CSS codes but neither worked. I spent a lot of time tryint to mimick the youtube <br />
videos and change the font in both CSS and html however in the end I could not do it. The thing I am most worried about is if the photos <br />
will work when the user goes to my link. Since the photos are in my ANTH 485/twine2 folder I do not know if it will work for them. <br />
I tried posting the direct URL but some of the images led to webistes as well as show the images, and the images were often too big. <br />
I watched this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZzChB75DFs&t=164s">youtubue video</a> to learn how to put a photo into twine. <br />
The problem however was that he is using a mac where I use windows. I really hope the images work, it took me a while to embed them into <br />
twine. I reshaped some of the photos in irfan view, and had to play around with the format. Ultimately I do not think this is the best <br />
portfolio project I have done but I did what I could and am glad for it to be over. </font>
