 <h3>why did you design the website the way you did? What went wrong? How would you address these issues in future? What do you think is successful about the project? Why?
  </h3>
<p>I designed this website to be clear, concise, and easily accessible. I wanted to demonstrate the knowledge I have obtained for coding in html and css. I used pictures from my hometown Vancouver, my family and of graffiti in Berlin. I thought they were accurate symbols of my interests: the beach, family and the nitty gritty. When designing this website I ran into the following issues: changing font color and style, adding borders to images, changing the color of the icons used, changing the banner color in the “blog” section, and changing the section id. At first I tried to solve these problems in html. I googled “how to…” and was overwhelmed by the answers google provided. I found it was frustrating trying to locate an appropriate solution and that google gave me multiple ways to solve one issue. This did not help. It would have been easier if I had a book which had sections I could look through. Although I completed the Codecademy “make a website” and “learn github” I do not feel they helped. I do not feel they related to the project I was doing. I wish I had completed the HTML and CSS codecademy prior to this project. I feel there would have been a few examples that were more relatable to the issues I had. Although simple and basic, without knowing the codes on how to fix these issues, they seemed impossible. Eventually I began to work in css, and found I could resolve the issues of font color and style. Although font was tricky. I wanted to use a font I had downloaded and was unable to find a way how to. The font is called “Bomber” so I created a file in my gh-pages and inserted things like “font-family: bomber” or in html “anth485/bomber/bomber.ttf” and so forth. Ultimately the program did not recognize the font and I ended up using “calibri”. When trying to change the border color of the “blog” area it was difficult to pinpoint if it was an issue for css or html. I tried to implement the color I wanted in both at different times and it would not work. Eventually when it did work (in html) it changed the colors of the icons within the banner, which I was unable to change back. Throughout the duration of this portfolio, I downloaded the same template 4 times. I kept losing track of where I was or could not spot where the coding had gone wrong. In the future I would like to have more knowledge about coding before I begin to create a project, have a book pertinent to the subject I am working on, and be more patient while coding. I get overwhelmed easily and when I do I shut down. Coding is about patience and precision. I will try to look through the history before re-downloading a template in the future. This will save me time and will teach me more about the program. Overall I like how the website turned out. I am glad to use the photos I did, the color scheme, and the map of my neighborhood. I think I did a good job at introducing myself to the web, and hope my personality was perceivable.
