 <h3>why did you design the website the way you did? What went wrong? How would you address these issues in future? What do you think is successful about the project? Why?</h3>

<p>I designed this website to illustrate who I think I am. I am a proud Vancouverite, close with my family, love the beach and street art. When designing this website I ran into a few issues: changing the background color, changing the icons, changing font color and style, and menu navigation. It was incredibly frustrating. Thankfully I resolved majority of these issues but some kinks remain. In the future to address these issues I would look at the history coding on github rather than re-download the template. I would also search for a coding book rather than rely on the internet. I found it very confusing to look through different web-pages since most of them offer different advice on the same issue. Overall, I am glad I could resolve some of the issues mentioned above. The project is successful in that it allowed me to showcase my life. I like how the project turned out. I like the color scheme, the photos I used, and the map I embedded showing Kitsilano (my neighborhood). I am proud of where I am from, and really enjoyed dedicating a webpage to it. In the beginning, middle and still now (the end) of this project, I have realized I am definitely not a coder. I get frustrated quickly, overwhelmed, confused and easily tire from focusing on the screen. However, I am learning a practical skill (and a few other lessons along the way), which fills me with pride and a sense of accomplishment.</p>
