      Jewish culture represented by <a href= http://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=4ce01596ee52a7c9d403f178546f5bc7&view=Cirrus Voyant</a>
<br />
My heritage project is about my grandparentâ€™s journey during the second World War. Over the
<br />
 summer my dad sister and I went to Poland and visited the locations mentioned in my Portfolio. 
<br />
It provides dates, places and images of where they lived. I chose to do the Jewish history website 
<br />
because it highlights key words that can articulate the holocaust by using places and words 
<br />
pertinent to the Jewish culture. I tried to use the yad-vashem (Israel Holocaust museum) archives 
<br />
of names as well as the Auschwitz tables of information, however I did not feel that they 
<br />
accurately represented the overall concept I am trying to portray. The Yad Vashem records did 
<br />
not transcend when I applied the URL in the voyant webpage. The Auschwitz URL only displayed 
<br />
words related to the camp or the museum. The <a href"http://www.jewishhistory.org/the-jews-come-to-poland/" Jewish history website</a> however conveyed 
<br />
meaningful words for Judaism and was the website which I could relate to the most (as a Jewish 
<br />
person). It gives an overview of the history of Jewish people living in Poland (pre-war) and is 
<br />
important in order to understand the extent of the atrocity that took place. For thousands of 
<br />
years Poland was home to a large Jewish population and within a 6 year period it became the 
<br />
most dangerous. I find Voyant very interesting. I like how you can adjust the number of words 
<br />
presented at one time, as well as the adjustable layout and fixed color scheme. This  presents the  
<br />
information as attractive and easily digestible. Although it does not present all the information 
<br />
at once, using recurring/main/overarching terms gives the reader an idea of what the topic is and 
<br />
what is to come. I think this is a useful tool.
