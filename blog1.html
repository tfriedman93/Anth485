Research and reflect:

Auschwitz: The Auschwitz museum website is interactive, educational, and clear. Each major topic is divided into sub headlines that are clearly laid out and accessible. It uses images, videos, maps, voice clips, social media, virtual tours, E-online learning and more. The interactive timeline it uses is unique in that it will give a break down of the year as well as pictures, maps and drawings (from previous prisoners) of the camp rather than give a linear timeline which the user can click a date and will be brought to. For example, click the down facing error underneath the title “history” on the bottom left at the top of the page. Select “Auschwitz l”, select >>> ONLINE SESSION. This will re-direct you to a page that has a manual slideshow, controllable by the arrows below. It provides a linear timeline along with specific details about the camp. Within these folders you will find maps, drawings, videos, images, documents, an interactive timeline and more. 

Visualizing the Holocaust: Is a blog post for the Emery center for Digital Scholarship. It presents the events of the holocaust to denounce holocaust deniers. It uses three interactive timelines: The rise of power and duration of the Holocaust, Revisionist History (Holocaust denier timeline), and judgement and remembrance (events related to and during Nuremburg trials). Each timeline has a window above which the user can control via arrows on the sides or by selecting dates on the timeline below. The slideshows contain images, videos, maps, drawings, hyperlinks, and documents. The second timeline (deniers) uses a Venn diagram as well as a tree diagram of the Canadian Judicial system. The blog post contains hyperlinks to webistes related to the holocaust and an image below of the “Hall of names” located in the “Yad Vashem” museum in Israel. 

Montreal Holocaust Museum: This website showcases the Museum’s exhibits, collections, information and visitor information. Under the education tab there are several sources/types of education. If you click “The History of the Holocaust” you will be brought to a page which gives an overview of the events that took place. The first section uses a slideshow of images and stories of Jewish life (before the war), culture and religion. Below are five interactive timelines: The Birth of the Nazi party, Anti Jewish laws, Empty acts: the world responds, the Second World War, and the Ghettos. Each timeline can be controlled by the arrows on your keyboard or by selecting the dates below. They use documents, photos, war paraphernalia/propaganda, facts, images, maps and more. You can click the images to get a closer view if need be. The hyperlinks throughout the page lead to either presentations/information packages prepared by the museum or a survivor testimonial page. 

I personally liked the Auschwitz website the most. I found it was jam-packed with information and used unique methods to engage the user (i.e. online session). It had facts which I had never considered or thought about before visiting Auschwitz and was presented in an easily digestible format. The blog website was limited and only provided three timelines—it was short and did not demonstrate the entirety of the history. However, I was very impressed by the use of the Venn diagram. The Montreal Museum website was mostly angled towards promoting the museum. The timelines were interactive, very education and I especially appreciated the survivors testimony page. Overall the recurring themes were video, images, maps, drawings, documents, hyperlinks, interactive timelines, and links to social media.
